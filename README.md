vim
===

Repository for my vim configuration, mainly vimrc.

To install:
    git clone https://github.com/ellingjp/vim.git path-to-temp-directory
    run setup.py
    open vim, run :BundleInstall

setup.py assumes an installation of msysgit as you might obtain from git-scm.com.  On Windows, the location of Git should be added to the PATH.  If this wasn't selected during the installation of Git, adding something like C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\cmd to your path should work.
